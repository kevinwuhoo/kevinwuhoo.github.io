        Hello, I'm Kevin Wu.

        I'm a software engineer who also likes learn about design and product.
        Currently at [Academia.edu](https://academia.edu) working on product driven
        development of tools that make scientists happy. Previously co-founded
        [Plasmyd.com](http://plasmyd.com) and in a past life, studied maize protemoics with
        [Steve Briggs](http://briggs.ucsd.edu) and
        [Justin Walley](http://www.plantpath.iastate.edu/people/justin-walley)
        at UCSD. Sometimes I regret not getting a PhD. I'd like to get back into
        teaching; feel free to reach out if you have an opporunity.

            Hypepy (pronounced hyphy) is an python wrapper around Hype Machine.
            Has support to fetch playlists and related metadata,
            but I mostly use it to download music from Hype Machine.
            Adds metadata and album art so it shows a nice image on my phone.

        [Came for a resume or CV? Here you go.](resume)

        I enjoy photography, but my portfolio site needs a redesign and is down
        for now. In the past I took lining up colors on the Rubik's cube seriously
        and my fastest single solve in competition was [15.60s](http://www.worldcubeassociation.org/results/p.php?i=2005WUKE01).

        I'm currently in the process of moving my blog to [Medium](https://medium.com/@kw).
        Turns out they don't allow you to add custom dates to your articles, so
        now a bunch of my posts will look like they were on the same day.

        If you'd like to contact me, I respond fastest on
        [Twitter](https://twitter.com/kevinwuhoo), but if it's
        long form, feel free to [email](mailto: me@kevinformatics.com) me.
        Here's a list of brand icons of other websites you can find me on.
